This is a place where you commit your work for each day of class. Many lab assignments will
have an autograded test that will run when you commit your work. You will be able to see
the results of the test in the Github Classroom interface. If your tests pass, that means 
you have done the lab correctly. If not, you will need to fix your work and commit again.
